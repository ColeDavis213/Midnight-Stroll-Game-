				Much better than everywhere else in this dingy little town, that’s for sure.

				Second of all, I was *trying* to get the scoop about the big power outage that happened a little bit ago.
				Everyone in town has been talking about it online, it’s going to be the biggest story for tomorrow's paper. 
				
				If I can get the writing credit for the story I'll get *my* name on the front page, and they'll finally have to promote me to Senior Intern Editor at the Daily Beagle!";

				All of my neighbors were asleep, but journalism does not tire!
