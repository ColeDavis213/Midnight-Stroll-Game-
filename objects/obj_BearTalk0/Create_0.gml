That right there...is a UFO!";
bearTexts[10] = @"No, no, that is a bonafide alien ship. 

But not just any alien ship, that's a *grey* ship.
				 
See, the greys are one of the most dangerous types of aliens out there. They make their ships look like normal stars by projecting atmospheric pressure rays to Earth and refracting any light to be seen as light from stars that would be close to their ship using advanced astronomical mapping software. But, like, sometimes, the electromagnetic waves they send while spying on us gives off a feedback and causes it to look like a blinking star.
				 
Of course, those waves can also reach Earth sometimes causing the power to go out."

I read all about it on this sick website online. It's got tons of really cool lime green text and a awesome starry background, it's super underground and *mysterious*!";
