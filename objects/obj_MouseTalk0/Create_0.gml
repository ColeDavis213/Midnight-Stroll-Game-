And as a matter of fact, it's not dangerous.

The records in the library show that this town's crime rate is way below national average compared to other suburban areas of this size.
Only 13 crimes commited in this park in the last decade, couting littering and vandalism.
If someone were to try to do something to me, I'd be happy to mix up the statistics."

Of course, there's also the law of unpredictability, but that's why I also have a can of mace with me."
