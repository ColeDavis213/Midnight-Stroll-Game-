sheepTexts[0] = @"Ooh! Hello!

You're here for the Starry Night Coven gathering tonight, right?";
sheepTexts[1] = @"Really? Thank goodness!

I thought no one was going to show up for a moment...

Ooh- but now you're here! I'm so excited! Although... your outfit could be a bit more on theme next time.

Aaaaanywaaaays, we're already 30 minuets behind schedule, let's begin begin our first activity! ";
sheepTexts[2] = @"Perfect!

As I mentioned in the weekly blog update, tonight we'll be making moon water!

Now I'm sure you're thinking, 'oh, but isn't that usually made during a full moon?' Well, yes. But! I thought that instead we'd do it on a cresent moon and make cresent moon water!

How cool does that sound???

Although I'm not sure what effects it will have, but that's part of the fun!";
sheepTexts[3] = @"Ok, we'll be doing it on this jar of water here, graciously provided by my kitchen sink.

But before we begin, we must start with step 0! Wand check!

Alright, let me see your wand! Is is whimsical and high-fantasy themed, or rustic and cozy-core? That's what mine is! I got it on this really cute and small website online. It's got all sorts of cool witchy stuff like crystals, spell books, and even hats! Although *mine* is custom made by myself, mostly cause theirs are like 200 dollars...

Oh! Sorry, I'm rambling like usual, I'm just so excited to actually be doing this with someone else. Anyways, let's see that wand!";
sheepTexts[4] = @"Oh...

T-that's fine then, really, it's not *really* necessary. It's mostly about your thoughts and intentions...AHG, but you already know that I'm sure! I'll.. I
I'll just shut up and get started.

Let's begin! Step 1: reciting the spell. Did you memorize the cantation I posted online, or did you write it done somewhere?";
sheepTexts[5] = "Huh? What do you mean?";
sheepTexts[6] = @"You're... oh, I knew it!

Of course you're not! Who would want to be part of my dumb little club!

I'm so stupid!"
sheepTexts[7] = "Really?"
sheepTexts[8] = @"Awwww, thank you!

I've never actually had a friend to do this kind of stuff with before. This will be great!

Oh, and don't worry about getting an outfit or wand if you don't want to. Just you being there is good enough for me!

I'll handle the activity planning too, no memorization needed!"
sheepTexts[9] = @"Yay!

I pronounce the *real* first gathering of the Starry Night Coven next Friday night 12 AM sharp!

See you then, witch buddy!"
