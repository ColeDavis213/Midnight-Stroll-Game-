					But this isn't my first night out here."

					It's just, I'm only 20, and already life just feels like a constant cycle day in and day out.
					
					I get to thinking if it's like this now, what's it gonna be like in 5, 10, even 20 years? Better? Worse? Exactly the same as it is now?
					
					I know it's all pretty surface level and I'm not trying to sound all deep and stuff, but, sometimes, all you can see is the tip of the iceberg.
					
					...That sounds fake deep again doesn't it? Anyways, you know what I mean, right?"
opossumTexts[10] = @"Good. Honestly, congrats.

					For me its kind of all I *can* think about.
					
					You don't have to worry about me though, I'll be fine.
					
					One day, a car zoomed by going way past the speed limit and it kind of reminded me of how fast it seems like life goes by sometimes. But as I watched it drive off, instead of seeing the black emptyness ahead as a void, it seemed at that moment more of a blank canvas. A limetless space for something new.";
					
opossumTexts[11] = @"Another time, on an especially dark night, there was a star that seemed almost twice as bright as usual, like a fire that was rekindled from luke-warm ashes.
					
					So yeah, I'll be ok. I'll get over whatever I'm dealing with. I just got to find the match to rekindle *my* fire.";					
					
opossumTexts[12] = @"Thanks, and, hey, it's never too late to start looking for your match.";
