Immediately inside is the living room.
Theres not much, but it's quaint.
A small mat welcomes all who visit.
		
To the left is your old, worn out couch.
		
In front of that is a small wooden coffee table topped
with a cermaic coffee mug still half-full and a book
that has sat unread for at least four years.
		
Up against the wall is a fireplace, although
electronic, and an ok-sized plasma TV, it is off.
		
To the right hangs an old family portrait.
Was your head always that big?
		
Below is the opening to the kitchen, and further
down is a small stand that holds a spriped glass vase.
You've always thought it was ugly.
