graveTexts[0] = @"It's your grandma's grave. 
				 She died a couple years ago at the ripe old age of 85.
				 You remember when you found out. You weren't as devasted as you might have thought to be. Not because you weren't sad, but it was apparent to everyone it was gonna happen soon with her declining health. Grandma even made jokes about herself passing. She even said she had looked foward to it party, it was nice to see her mind had kept.
				 Though it still stung knowing there would be no more visits for her to tell stories of her time as a nurse in the 50's and how life was back then. She had a way in making it sound so interesting and different."
				 
graveTexts[1] =	 @"Thinking about it now it really made you think about how much time 85 years really is. You can hardly imagine making it to 85. What would you be doing then? What would you have done all those years before?
				 However, you find it a bit selfish to be thinking about yourself so much at a grave of someone you loved.
				 You decide it's for the best that you pay your respects once more and go.";
