				There is a horrible smell that hits your nose akin to rotting garbage.
				
				Coincidentally, there is a large metal dumpster piled high with rotting garbage shoved against the right wall. Its overflowing with bags and boxes. 
				
				Flies swarm it happily.
				
				Behind it is the side door to Dean's presumably used for taking out the trash or takeing a much needed breath of air not lined with grease.
				
				At the end is a metal drain with some liquid poruing down into the the drainage below.";
alleyTexts[1] = @"You've never actually done this before, but there's a first time for everything.
				
				The smell is only stronger from up close. You can slightly make out the scent of old fries, rotting vegetables, and grease.
				
				You look deeper in to see if there is any thing but garbage in the giant box made specifically to hold garbage.
				
				Suprisingly, you end up seeing something shine from a the light  windows above."
