alleyTexts[0] = @"It's the dark, dingy back alley between Dean's diner and some old apartment.

				There is a horrible smell that hits your nose akin to rotting garbage.
				
				Coincidentally, there is a large metal dumpster piled high with rotting garbage shoved against the right wall. Its overflowing with bags and boxes. 
				
				Flies swarm it happily.
				
				Behind it is the side door to Dean's presumably used for taking out the trash or takeing a much needed breath of air not lined with grease.
				
				At the end is a metal drain with some liquid poruing down into the the drainage below.";
alleyTexts[1] = @"You've never actually done this before, but there's a first time for everything.
				
				The smell is only stronger from up close. You can slightly make out the scent of old fries, rotting vegetables, and grease.
				
				You look deeper in to see if there is any thing but garbage in the giant box made specifically to hold garbage.
				
				Suprisingly, you end up seeing something reflect the faint light from the windows above."
alleyTexts[2] = @"You plunge your hand into the dumpster lifting the odd shaped object out of the trash.

				However, as you grab onto the object, one of the garbage bags next to it, and your 
arm, begins to shake. 

				It's sudden, but it gets stronger and stronger as you realize your arm is still deep into the trash, right next to it.";
alleyTexts[3] = @"You quicky reach into your pocket with your other arm and whip out the knife Ember gave you.

				Hastily, you stab into the bag and cut open a large slit down the wearing plastic. You missed, whatever was inside, but managed to cut open a large opening.
				
				Out of the darkness, something bursts from the bag!";
alleyTexts[4] = @"It's- a baby racoon...
				
				You watch as its small furry body lunges out on the the top of the trash, holding half of a bun in its mouth.
				
				It doesn't take the time to hiss or put too much mind to you, it only stares breifly at you with its small, black beady eyes before scuttering off the dumpster and down into the further darkness of the alley.
				
				You are immediently happy that you *did* miss the contents of the bag.";
alleyTexts[5] = @"You reach back down again past the torn bag, now leaking a foul smelling ooze.

				You push down to grab the object and quickly pull it up this time revealing, oh man, no way!
				
				It's an unopened amiigo figurine! You used to collect these a couple years ago. Why would anyone throw one of *these* away? You already own this character, it's one of over fifty you now keep locked away in a wooden chest, but you decide theres nothing wrong with one extra.
				
				You could maybe even sell it online, surely they are selling for just as much as they did a few years ago.
				
				You fit it snuggly in your hoodie pocket, content with your decision to rummage through the trash."
