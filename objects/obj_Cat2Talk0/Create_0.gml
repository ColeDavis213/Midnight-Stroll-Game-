				One time, I went to give a lady her food and I only gave her three ketchup packets instead
				of four and she got so mad at me she yelled at me *reall loud* in front of the whole store!
				
				Another time, I accidently tripped and dropped someones drink and got yelled at, and once when
				someones' fries weren't salty enough I got yelled at for it, oh and then a couple days ago-"

				Alright, well around when I first got hired, I was working the counter when all the sudden this big
				guy in a black hoodie came in. He had both hooves in his pocket and sunglasses on and I panicked
				and ran to the back and hid behind the fryer and I..I..I peed myself a little...";
cat2Texts[6] = @"Oh. Well.

				One of the cooks went to go see what was going on after he noticed no one was at the counter for...about 20 minutes, and it turns out that it was just Buck, the cashier over there at the counter. He was coming in to apply for a job.
				
				I asked him why he came in like that later and he said that he didn't want people to see someone of his status in a 'place like this'.
				
				He's been working here for a couple months now and he's just now stopped calling in sick for his counter shifts.
				
				Oh! But, I'm not meaning to sound rude! He's actually a really good employee...when he tries."
cat2Texts[7] = @"I...thanks...

				Well, I should get back to mopping now.
				
				I really don't get how these floors get so dirty, like *really* dirty. Do people mean throw their french fries 
				on the ground? Are they playing a game with them? Who can get the floors the dirtiest? Do they even think about 
				how someone has to clean it up? And don’t even get me started with what's left on the tables…....and the wrappers…… 
				so much wasted food……….tracking ketchup into the bathroom…….*mumble mumble mumble*……."
